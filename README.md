# OpticalOptimization
**Currently Archived**

The goal of the optical optimization project is to build a library to design optical systems that can be optimized for maximum performance.

I started this project as part of my Optics Final project where my goal was to develop an optical set of contact lenses that factor in cost, optical correction & material design (Wettability, H20 Content, hardness etc).

This project is designed in julid and built upon the [OpticSim.jl](https://github.com/microsoft/OpticSim.jl) project. In order to work with my personal interface libraries, this project was cloned and modified

I unfortunately had to archive this project for now as I ran out of time but I am returning back to machine learning and may pick this project back up.
